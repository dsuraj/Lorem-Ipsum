Project allows users to create better placeholder text than traditional lorem ipsum through categories, headings and contextual designs.

DESCRIPTION

Traditional Lorem Ipsum has been the default to create placeholder text for websites. Startup Ipsum enables users to create more contextual text by using categories to filter the copy to be rendered and headings to drill down on specific sections of the website. For added effect, images and other design elements are presented in order for the user to visualise the context further.

Features:
- Startup ipsum copy based on selected category
- Even more startup ipsum copy based on headings
- Images inserted based on category
- Designs inserted based on headings
- Ability to edit copy
- Ability to move headings on site
- Ability to import own images
